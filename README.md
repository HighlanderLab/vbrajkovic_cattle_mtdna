# Analysis of the effect of mtDNA on dairy cattle performance

## Major TO DO
- Clean and comment main script as much as possible 
- Clean the functions file; what is actually used? 

## Minor TO DO 
- All analyses currently in one big R script; possibly break into parts?
- Data files kept locally  
- Many bits of the code were for testing purposes only (I think most was cleaned in September 2020)
- If public version is to be provided for publication additional cleaning needed
- I don't necesseraly remember the source of some functions in functions script (some are adapted from Gregor and Maria for sure...)
